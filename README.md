# Flight Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project aims to predict flight prices based on various features such as departure and arrival dates, airline, source and destination airports, and more. The model is built using a Linear Regression algorithm.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a flight ticket based on a variety of input features. We used a Linear Regression model to solve this problem, utilizing a dataset containing historical flight price data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains flight details including the following features:

- `Airline`: The airline operating the flight.
- `Source`: The source airport.
- `Destination`: The destination airport.
- `Date_of_Journey`: The date the flight was booked.
- `Dep_Time`: The time the flight departs.
- `Arrival_Time`: The time the flight arrives.
- `Duration`: The duration of the flight.
- `Total_Stops`: The number of stops in the flight.
- `Additional_Info`: Additional flight details such as whether the flight is non-stop, etc.
- `Price`: The target variable (the flight price to be predicted).

For detailed information, refer to the dataset.
