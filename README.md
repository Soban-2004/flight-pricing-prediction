# Flight Price Prediction Web App using Linear Regression

This project is a web application built using Python and Streamlit that predicts flight prices based on various features. The machine learning model used for prediction is Linear Regression, and the app allows users to input flight details to estimate the price.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly web application where users can input flight details, and the model will predict the expected flight price. The Linear Regression model is trained on historical flight data that includes features such as airline, source, destination, flight duration, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Flight Price Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), which contains historical flight prices along with associated flight details like:

- `Airline`: Airline name
- `Source`: The source airport code
- `Destination`: The destination airport code
- `Duration`: The duration of the flight
- `Date`: Date of the flight
- `Price`: The price of the flight (target variable)
